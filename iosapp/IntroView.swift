It was developed and well-validated from real normal and hypothyroid human data*. It accepts an individualâ€™s hormone, gender, weight and height data, as well as hormone dosing options, and provides graphs of their simulated hormone dynamic responses, for euthyroid and hypothyroid conditions, over periods up to 100 days. Users simulate common thyroid system maladies by adjusting TH secretion and/or absorption rates and simulation intervals)on the interface (in Step 1). For patients receiving replacement hormones, Step 2 provides several and/or multiple oral input dosing options. Intravenous bolus and/or infusion inputs can also be chosen, for exploratory research and teaching demonstrations. For easy comparisons, the interface includes facility for superimposing 2 sets of simulation results (Step3). Importantly, p-THYROSIM is not for self-medication, and not a substitute for professional medical advice. By offering a user-friendly interface, it enables users to gain insights into complex thyroid hormone interactions with remarkable precision. Whether for academic learning or clinical teaching, the tool serves as a gateway to unraveling the intricacies of thyroid physiology. Furthermore, its ability to simulate personalized responses to varied conditions makes it invaluable for advancing both education and exploratory research as well as clinical applications.")
